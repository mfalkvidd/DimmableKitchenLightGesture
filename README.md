# DimmableKitchenLightGesture
Dimmable LED kitchen light using Arduino and the APDS-9660 gesture sensor and a 12V RGBWW led strip.

Set light level by moving your hand up and down in front of the sensor. Hold still for 1 second to lock the light level.

Color/temperature calibrated to match the rest of my kitchen lights. Will ignore calibration if set at highest light level.
